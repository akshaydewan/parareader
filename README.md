# ParaReader

## Read a paragraph comfortably

This is a firefox extension that opens a modal to read the selected text with better formatting. I made it for reading emails and text that are otherwise not compatible with firefox's in-built Reader mode. 

## Current limitations:
- Uses a fixed formatting with no way to customize
- All markup is lost in the reader mode - it shows plain text
- Currently not hosted on addons.mozilla.org

# ParaReader

## Read a paragraph comfortably

This is a firefox extension that opens a modal to read the selected text with better formatting. I made it for reading emails and text that are otherwise not compatible with firefox's in-built Reader mode. 

## Installation
Get it from: [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/parareader/)

## Usage
Select some text, and press Cmd+Shift+X on MacOS or Alt+Shift+X on Windows/Linux.

If you want to change the key binding, you can go to about:addons > click on the gear icon > Manage extension shortcuts.

## Current limitations:
- Uses a fixed formatting with no way to customize
- All markup (links etc.) are lost in the reader - it shows plain text
